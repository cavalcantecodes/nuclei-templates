## üìò Introduction to Nuclei Templates

Nuclei templates are essentially YAML formatted scripts that instruct the Nuclei engine on what to look for when scanning targets. They are pivotal in identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or informational insights about a target.

## üèóÔ∏è Template Structure

A basic Nuclei template consists of:

```yaml
id: unique-id-for-template

info:
  name: Template Name
  author: Your Name
  severity: low|medium|high|critical|info
  description: Short description about the template.

requests:
  - raw:
      - |
        GET /path HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}

    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          - "specific-string-to-look-for"
```

## üéØ Matchers and Extractors

**Matchers**:
Matchers are conditions that must be satisfied for a request to be considered a match.

- **Word Matcher**: Matches if a word or set of words are found in the HTTP response body.
- **Regex Matcher**: Uses regular expressions to identify matches.
- **Status Matcher**: Matches based on the HTTP response status code.
  
**Extractors**:
Extractors are used to extract and display specific information from the HTTP response.

- **Regex Extractor**: Pulls out specific pieces of data using regular expressions.
